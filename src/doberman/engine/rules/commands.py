"""Destructive-command rule (Feature 3, slice 3.4).

Blocks catastrophic shell/git commands and steps up authentication on
risky-but-recoverable ones. Command parsing is treated as **adversarial**: a
single command string may chain many commands with ``;``, ``&&``, ``||``, or
pipes, hide work in ``$(...)``/backtick substitutions, or carry an opaque
payload (``bash -c "<base64>"``). We therefore:

* split the command line into segments on the shell operators, and recurse into
  command-substitution bodies, so a destructive segment anywhere in the line is
  seen;
* match each segment's argv (parsed with :mod:`shlex`, env-assignment and
  ``sudo``/``nice`` prefixes stripped) against deny / step-up tables;
* treat anything we **cannot** confidently parse — opaque ``-c`` payloads,
  unbalanced quoting — as ``AUTH``, never PASS. We never *execute* anything to
  analyze it.

Verdicts:

* ``rm -rf /`` (or ``~`` / ``/*``), disk wipes (``mkfs``, ``dd of=/dev/...``),
  ``git push --force`` to a protected branch, fork bombs → ``BLOCK
  (destructive_command)``.
* recoverable-but-risky (``sudo``, ``curl | sh``, bulk deletes at/over the
  threshold, ``git reset --hard``) → ``AUTH``.
* opaque / unparseable commands → ``AUTH (opaque_command)``.
* small/benign commands → abstain (``PASS``).

SECURITY: the explanation names the *category* of danger, never echoes the
command string or its arguments.
